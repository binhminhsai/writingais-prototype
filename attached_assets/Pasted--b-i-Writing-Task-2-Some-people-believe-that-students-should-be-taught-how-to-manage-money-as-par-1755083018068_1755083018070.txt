Đề bài Writing Task 2:
Some people believe that students should be taught how to manage money as part of their school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Bài luận Task 2 (mẫu):
In today's consumer-driven society, financial literacy has become increasingly important, and some argue that schools should incorporate money management into their curriculum. I completely agree with this view, as it equips young people with essential life skills and prevents future financial pitfalls.
Firstly, teaching students about money management at school would provide them with foundational knowledge that many lack when entering adulthood. For instance, concepts such as budgeting, saving, and understanding interest rates are rarely covered in traditional subjects like mathematics or history. Without this education, young adults often face challenges like accumulating debt from credit cards or poor investment decisions. By integrating these topics into the school syllabus, students can develop practical skills early on, leading to more responsible financial behavior in the future. This proactive approach could reduce societal issues like bankruptcy and financial inequality.
Moreover, schools are an ideal environment for imparting impartial and structured financial education. Parents may not always have the time or expertise to teach these matters effectively, and external sources like online resources can be unreliable or biased. In contrast, a school-based program ensures that all students, regardless of their background, receive consistent and accurate information. For example, countries like Australia have implemented financial literacy courses in schools, resulting in improved financial decision-making among graduates, as evidenced by lower rates of youth debt.
In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of teaching money management in schools, as it fosters independence and long-term financial stability. Implementing this would benefit individuals and society as a whole.
